HashMap is an array of linkedLists and each slot which has a linkedlist called a bucket.

If we want to put something to the array, we pass it to the hash function then based on the value we will only the check the 
specific bucket for the value. 

Suppose there are 'n' elements.	'N' buckets then lambda= n/N
lambda  = loading factor(avg num of elemnt per bucket)

lambda<=k(a threshold value)

As the n inc, the lambda will also inc so after very put we will check if the lamda is less then k or not.
if it exceeds the 'k', then we will apply the re-hash function. 
re hashing is size of array is doubled and elements added again to it.

put() - O(lambda)
